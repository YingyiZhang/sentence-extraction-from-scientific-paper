1	This paper presents a new approach to statistical sentence generation in which alternative phrases are represented as packed sets of trees , or forests , and then ranked statistically to choose the best one .	T
2	This representation offers advantages in compactness and in the ability to represent syntactic information .	T
3	It also facilitates more efficient statistical ranking than a previous approach to statistical generation .	T
4	An efficient ranking algorithm is described , together with experimental results showing significant improvements over simple enumeration or a lattice-based approach .	M
5	This paper describes a domain independent strategy for the multimedia articulation of answers elicited by a natural language interface to database query applications .	MT
6	Multimedia answers include videodisc images and heuristically-produced complete sentences in text or text-to-speech form .	O
7	Deictic reference and feedback about the discourse are enabled .	O
