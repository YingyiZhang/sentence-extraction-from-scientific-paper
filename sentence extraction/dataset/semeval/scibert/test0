1310	using natural language processing , we carried out a trend survey on japanese natural language processing studies that have been done over the last ten years .	MT
1311	we determined the changes in the number of papers published for each research organization and on each research area as well as the relationship between research organizations and research areas .	O
1312	this paper is useful for both recognizing trends in japanese nl # # p and constructing a method of supporting trend surveys using nl # # p .	MT
1313	we propose a draft scheme of the model formal # # iz ##ing the structure of communicative context in dialogue interaction .	T
1314	the relationships between the interacting partners are considered as system of three automata representing the partners of the dialogue and environment .	O
1315	this paper examines what kind of similarity between words can be represented by what kind of word vectors in the vector space model .	M
1316	through two experiments , three methods for constructing word vectors , i . e . , ls # # a - based , co # # occurrence - based and dictionary - based methods , were compared in terms of the ability to represent two kinds of similarity , i . e . , taxonomic similarity and associative similarity .	MT
1317	the result of the comparison was that the dictionary - based word vectors better reflect taxonomic similarity , while the ls # # a - based and the co # # occurrence - based word vectors better reflect associative similarity .	MT
1318	in this paper , we present a novel training method for a localized phrase - based prediction model for statistical machine translation - lr # # b - sm # # t - rr # # b - .	MT
1319	the model predicts blocks with orientation to handle local phrase re - ordering .	MT
1320	we use a maximum likelihood criterion to train a log - linear block big # # ram model which uses real - valued features - lr # # b - e . g . a language model score - rr # # b - as well as binary features based on the block identities themselves , e . g . block big # # ram features .	MT
1321	our training algorithm can easily handle millions of features .	MT
1322	the best system obtains a 18 . 6 % improvement over the baseline on a standard arabic - english translation task .	T
1323	statistical language modeling remains a challenging task , in particular for morphologically rich languages .	T
1324	recently , new approaches based on factor # # ed language models have been developed to address this problem .	M
1325	these models provide principle # # d ways of including additional conditioning variables other than the preceding words , such as morphological or syntactic features .	T
1326	however , the number of possible choices for model parameters creates a large space of models that can not be searched exhaustive # # ly .	O
1327	this paper presents an entirely data - driven model selection procedure based on genetic search , which is shown to outperform both knowledge - based and random selection procedures on two different language modeling tasks - lr # # b - arabic and turkish - rr # # b - .	MT
1328	the prc adaptive knowledge - based text understanding system - lr # # b - pak # # tu # # s - rr # # b - has been under development as an independent research and development project at prc since 1984 .	M
1329	the objective is a generic system of tools , including a core english lexicon , grammar , and concept representations , for building natural language processing - lr # # b - nl # # p - rr # # b - systems for text understanding .	MT
1330	systems built with pak # # tu # # s are intended to generate input to knowledge based systems ord # # ata base systems .	MT
1331	input to the nl # # p system is typically derived from an existing electronic message stream , such as a news wire .	M
1332	pak # # tu # # s supports the adaptation of the generic core to a variety of domains : jin # # tac # # cs messages , rain # # form messages , news reports about a specific type of event , such as financial transfers or terror # # ist acts , etc . , by acquiring sub # # language and domain - specific grammar , words , conceptual mappings , and discourse patterns .	MT
1333	the long - term goal is a system that can support the processing of relatively long discourse # # s in domains that are fairly broad with a high rate of success .	T
1334	this paper describes the understanding process of the spatial descriptions in japanese .	M
1335	in order to understand the described world , the authors try to reconstruct the geometric model of the global scene from the scen # # ic descriptions drawing a space .	MT
1336	it is done by an experimental computer program spr # # int , which takes natural language texts and produces a model of the described world .	MT
1337	to reconstruct the model , the authors extract the qualitative spatial constraints from the text , and represent them as the numerical constraints on the spatial attributes of the entities .	MT
1338	this makes it possible to express the vague # # nes ##s of the spatial concepts and to derive the maximally plausible interpretation from a chunk of information accumulated as the constraints .	T
1339	the interpretation reflects the temporary belief about the world .	O
1340	in this paper , we describe a phrase - based uni # # gram model for statistical machine translation that uses a much simpler set of model parameters than similar phrase - based models .	MT
1341	the units of translation are blocks - pairs of phrases .	O
1342	during decoding , we use a block uni # # gram model and a word - based trig # # ram language model .	M
1343	during training , the blocks are learned from source interval projections using an underlying word alignment .	M
1344	we show experimental results on block selection criteria based on uni # # gram counts and phrase length .	M
1345	state - of - the - art question answering - lr # # b - qa - rr # # b - systems are very sensitive to variations in the phr # # as ##ing of an information need .	M
1346	finding the preferred language for such a need is a valuable task .	O
1347	we investigate that claim by adopting a simple mt - based parap # # hr # # as ##ing technique and evaluating qa system performance on parap # # hr # # ase ##d questions .	M
1348	we found a potential increase of 35 % in mr # # r with respect to the original question .	M
1349	in the chinese language , a verb may have its dependent # # s on its left , right or on both sides .	O
1350	the ambiguity resolution of right - side dependencies is essential for dependency parsing of sentences with two or more verbs .	MT
1351	previous works on shift - reduce dependency parser # # s may not guarantee the connectivity of a dependency tree due to their weakness at resolving the right - side dependencies .	MT
1352	this paper proposes a two - phase shift - reduce dependency parser based on svm learning .	M
1353	the left - side dependent # # s and right - side nominal dependent # # s are detected in phase i , and right - side verbal dependent # # s are decided in phase ii .	O
1354	in experimental evaluation , our proposed method outperforms previous shift - reduce dependency parser # # s for the chin # # e language , showing improvement of dependency accuracy by 10 . 08 % .	M
1355	recent advances in automatic speech recognition technology have put the goal of naturally sound # # ing dialog systems within reach .	M
1356	however , the improved speech recognition has brought to light a new problem : as dialog systems understand more of what the user tells them , they need to be more sophisticated at responding to the user .	MT
1357	the issue of system response to users has been extensively studied by the natural language generation community , though rarely in the context of dialog systems .	M
1358	we show how research in generation can be adapted to dialog systems , and how the high cost of hand - cra # # ft # # ing knowledge - based generation systems can be overcome by employing machine learning techniques .	MT
1359	this paper presents a word segmentation system in france telec # # om r & d beijing , which uses a unified approach to word breaking and oo # # v identification .	MT
1360	the output can be customized to meet different segmentation standards through the application of an ordered list of transformation .	M
1361	the system participated in all the tracks of the segmentation bak # # e # # off - - pk - open , pk - closed , as - open , as - closed , hk - open , hk - closed , ms # # r - open and ms # # r - closed - - and achieved the state - of - the - art performance in ms # # r - open , ms # # r - close and pk - open tracks .	O
1362	analysis of the results shows that each component of the system contributed to the scores .	O
1363	in this paper i will argue for a model of grammatical processing that is based on uniform processing and knowledge sources .	MT
1364	the main feature of this model is to view parsing and generation as two strongly interle # # ave ##d tasks performed by a single parametri # # ze ##d deduc # # tion process .	MT
1365	it will be shown that this view supports flexible and efficient natural language processing .	T
1366	this report describes paul , a computer text generation system designed to create cohe # # siv ##e text through the use of lexical substitutions .	MT
1367	specifically , this system is designed to deterministic # # ally choose between prono # # min # # ali # # za ##tion , super # # ord ##inate substitution , and definite noun phrase re # # iter # # ation .	T
1368	the system identifies a strength of antec # # ed ##e # # nc # # e recovery for each of the lexical substitutions , and matches them against the strength of potential antec # # ed ##e # # nc # # e of each element in the text to select the proper substitutions for these elements .	T
1369	this paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of local coherence .	T
1370	we present a novel entity - based representation of discourse which is inspired by center # # ing theory and can be computed automatically from raw text .	M
1371	we view coherence assessment as a ranking learning problem and show that the proposed discourse representation supports the effective learning of a ranking function .	MT
1372	our experiments demonstrate that the induced model achieves significantly higher accuracy than a state - of - the - art coherence model .	M
1373	sentiment classification seeks to identify a piece of text according to its author ' s general feeling toward their subject , be it positive or negative .	M
1374	traditional machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem with reasonable success , but they have been shown to work well only when there is a good match between the training and test data with respect to topic .	M
1375	this paper demonstrates that match with respect to domain and time is also important , and presents preliminary experiments with training data labeled with emo # # tic # # ons , which has the potential of being independent of domain , topic and time .	O
1376	we argue in favor of the the use of labeled directed graph to represent various types of linguistic structures , and illustrate how this allows one to view nl # # p tasks as graph transformations .	MT
1377	we present a general method for learning such transformations from an annotated corpus and describe experiments with two applications of the method : identification of non - local dep # # en ##en # # ci # # es - lr # # b - using penn tree # # bank data - rr # # b - and semantic role labeling - lr # # b - using proposition bank data - rr # # b - .	T
1378	this paper investigates some computational problems associated with probabilistic translation models that have recently been adopted in the literature on machine translation .	MT
1379	these models can be viewed as pairs of probabilistic context - free grammars working in a ` synchronous ' way .	M
1380	two hardness results for the class np are reported , along with an exponential time lower - bound for certain classes of algorithms that are currently used in the literature .	O
1381	in this paper , we present a fully automated extraction system , named inte # # x , to identify gene and protein interactions in biomedical text .	MT
1382	our approach is based on first splitting complex sentences into simple cla # # usa ##l structures made up of syntactic roles .	M
1383	then , tagging biological entities with the help of biomedical and linguistic ontologies .	MT
1384	finally , extracting complete interactions by analyzing the matching contents of syntactic roles and their linguistic # # ally significant combinations .	MT
1385	our extraction system handles complex sentences and extracts multiple and nested interactions specified in a sentence .	MT
1386	experimental evaluations with two other state of the art extraction systems indicate that the inte # # x system achieves better performance without the labor intensive pattern engineering requirement .	M
1387	the inter # # ling # # ua ##l approach to mt has been repeatedly advocated by researchers originally interested in natural language understanding who take machine translation to be one possible application .	MT
1388	however , not only the ambiguity but also the vague # # nes ##s which every natural language inevitably has leads this approach into essential difficulties .	O
1389	in contrast , our project , the mu - project , adopts the transfer approach as the basic framework of mt .	MT
1390	this paper describes the detailed construction of the transfer phase of our system from japanese to english , and gives some examples of problems which seem difficult to treat in the inter # # ling # # ua ##l approach .	MT
1391	the basic design principles of the transfer phase of our system have already been mentioned in - lr # # b - 1 - rr # # b - - lr # # b - 2 - rr # # b - .	O
1392	some of the principles which are relevant to the topic of this paper are : - lr # # b - a - rr # # b - multiple layer of grammars - lr # # b - b - rr # # b - multiple layer presentation - lr # # b - c - rr # # b - lexicon driven processing - lr # # b - d - rr # # b - form - oriented dictionary description .	M
1393	this paper also shows how these principles are realized in the current system .	O
1394	sentence boundary detection in speech is important for enrich # # ing speech recognition output , making it easier for humans to read and downstream modules to process .	MT
1395	in previous work , we have developed hidden markov model - lr # # b - hmm - rr # # b - and maximum entropy - lr # # b - max # # ent - rr # # b - classifiers that integrate textual and prosodic knowledge sources for detecting sentence boundaries .	MT
1396	in this paper , we evaluate the use of a conditional random field - lr # # b - crf - rr # # b - for this task and relate results with this model to our prior work .	M
1397	we evaluate across two corpora - lr # # b - conversation # # al telephone speech and broadcast news speech - rr # # b - on both human transcription # # s and speech recognition output .	O
1398	in general , our crf model yields a lower error rate than the hmm and max - ent models on the nist sentence boundary detection task in speech , although it is interesting to note that the best results are achieved by three - way voting among the classifiers .	MT
1399	this probably occurs because each model has different strengths and weaknesses for modeling the knowledge sources .	T
1400	topical blog post retrieval is the task of ranking blog posts with respect to their relevance for a given topic .	T
1401	to improve topical blog post retrieval we incorporate textual credibility indicators in the retrieval process .	MT
1402	we consider two groups of indicators : post level - lr # # b - determined using information about individual blog posts only - rr # # b - and blog level - lr # # b - determined using information from the underlying blog # # s - rr # # b - .	M
1403	we describe how to estimate these indicators and how to integrate them into a retrieval approach based on language models .	MT
1404	experiments on the tre # # c blog track test set show that both groups of credibility indicators significantly improve retrieval effectiveness ; the best performance is achieved when combining them .	T
1405	determine # # rs play an important role in convey # # ing the meaning of an utterance , but they have often been disreg # # ar ##ded , perhaps because it seemed more important to devi # # se methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence , even if not in a precise way .	MT
1406	another problem with determine # # rs is their inherent ambiguity .	MT
1407	in this paper we propose a logical formalism , which , among other things , is suitable for representing determine # # rs without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear .	MT
1408	we provide a unified account of sentence - level and text - level anaph # # or ##a within the framework of a dependency - based grammar model .	MT
1409	criteria for anaph # # or ##a resolution within sentence boundaries rep # # hr # # ase major concepts from gb ' s binding theory , while those for text - level anaph # # or ##a incorporate an adapted version of a gros # # z - sid # # ner - style focus model .	MT
1410	gloss # # er is designed to support reading and learning to read in a foreign language .	MT
1411	there are four language pairs currently supported by gloss # # er : english - bul # # gar # # ian , english - est # # on ##ian , english - hung # # ari ##an and french - dutch .	M
1412	the program is operational on uni # # x and windows ' 95 platforms , and has undergone a pilot user - study .	M
1413	a demonstration - lr # # b - in uni # # x - rr # # b - for applied natural language processing emphasizes components put to novel technical uses in intelligent computer - assisted morphological analysis - lr # # b - ica # # ll - rr # # b - , including disambig # # ua ##ted morphological analysis and lemma # # ti ##zed indexing for an aligned bilingual corpus of word examples .	MT
1414	we suggest a new goal and evaluation criterion for word similarity measures .	MT
1415	the new criterion meaning - entail # # ing substitu # # tab # # ili ##ty fits the needs of semantic - oriented nl # # p applications and can be evaluated directly - lr # # b - independent of an application - rr # # b - at a good level of human agreement .	MT
1416	motivated by this semantic criterion we analyze the empirical quality of distributional word feature vectors and its impact on word similarity results , proposing an objective measure for evaluating feature vector quality .	MT
1417	finally , a novel feature weighting and selection function is presented , which yields superior feature vectors and better word similarity performance .	MT
1418	combination methods are an effective way of improving system performance .	MT
1419	this paper examines the benefits of system combination for unsupervised ws # # d .	T
1420	we investigate several voting - and arb # # iter - based combination strategies over a diverse pool of unsupervised ws # # d systems .	M
1421	our combination methods rely on predominant senses which are derived automatically from raw text .	M
1422	experiments using the sem # # cor and sense # # val - 3 data sets demonstrate that our ensembles yield significantly better results when compared with state - of - the - art .	M
1423	we investigate independent and relevant event - based extract # # ive mut # # li - document summar # # iz ##ation approaches .	M
1424	in this paper , events are defined as event terms and associated event elements .	O
1425	with independent approach , we identify important contents by frequency of events .	MT
1426	with relevant approach , we identify important contents by page # # rank algorithm on the event map constructed from documents .	MT
1427	experimental results are encouraging .	O
1428	we present the first application of the head - driven statistical parsing model of collins - lr # # b - 1999 - rr # # b - as a simultaneous language model and parser for large - vocabulary speech recognition .	MT
1429	the model is adapted to an online left to right chart - parser for word lattices , integrating acoustic , n - gram , and parser probabilities .	M
1430	the parser uses structural and lexical dependencies not considered by n - gram models , conditioning recognition on more linguistic # # ally - grounded relationships .	MT
1431	experiments on the wall street journal tree # # bank and lattice corpora show word error rates competitive with the standard n - gram language model while extracting additional structural information useful for speech understanding .	MT
1432	both rhetor # # ica ##l structure and punct # # ua ##tion have been helpful in discourse processing .	MT
1433	based on a corpus annotation project , this paper reports the disc # # urs # # ive usage of 6 chinese punct # # ua ##tion marks in news commentary texts : colon , dash , ellip # # sis , excl # # am ##a # # tion mark , question mark , and semic # # ol ##o # # n .	MT
1434	the rhetor # # ica ##l patterns of these marks are compared against patterns around cue phrases in general .	O
1435	results show that these chinese punct # # ua ##tion marks , though fewer in number than cue phrases , are easy to identify , have strong correlation with certain relations , and can be used as distinctive indicators of nuclear # # ity in chinese texts .	M
1436	this paper describes three relatively domain - independent capabilities recently added to the param # # ax spoken language understanding system : non - monotonic reasoning , implicit reference resolution , and database query parap # # hr # # ase .	MT
1437	in addition , we discuss the results of the february 1992 ati # # s benchmark tests .	M
1438	we describe a variation on the standard evaluation metric which provides a more tightly controlled measure of progress .	O
1439	finally , we briefly describe an experiment which we have done in extending the n - best speech / language integration architecture to improving oc # # r accuracy .	T
